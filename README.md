A comprehensive inverse kinematics tool for Unreal Engine 4. Name TBD

WEEK 3 REPORT:

Got the project set up, have set up a bunch of utility / boilerplate stuff. So far I have:

 - A game environement for testing, including character models and a pretty comprehensive animation set (yay!)
 - Simple patrol AI for the characters, I've found this very useful for testing
 - A growing set of libraries / utilities

The UE4 AnimGraph system has been updated since I last worked with it and is giving me a lot of trouble. Hoping
to have actual bone controllers and the beginnings of the leg IK system up and running in the next day or two.
